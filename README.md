# Covid-19-Data-Exploration-SQL
In this data analysis project, data of Covid-19 was used by me.
The data was analyzed to find- the likelihood of dying if Covid is
contracted, percentage of the population infected, countries with the
highest infection rate compared to the population, countries and
continents with highest death count per population and the percentage
of population that has received at least one Covid vaccine.
